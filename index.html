title: The speed of a single-page web application without having to write any JavaScript.
description: >-
  Turbo accelerates links and form submissions without requiring you to change your server-side generated HTML.
  It lets you carve up a page into independent frames, which can be lazy-loaded and operate as independent components.
  And finally, helps you make partial page updates using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like container tags.
  These three techniques reduce the amount of custom JavaScript that many web applications need to write by an order of magnitude.

    <strong>Turbo</strong> uses complementary techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of custom JavaScript that most web applications will need to write:
  </p>

  <ul>
    <li><em>Turbo Drive</em> accelerates links and form submissions by negating the need for full page reloads.</li>
    <li><em>Turbo Frames</em> decompose pages into independent contexts, which scope navigation and can be lazily loaded.
    <li><em>Turbo Streams</em> deliver page changes over WebSocket or in response to form submissions using just HTML and a set of CRUD-like actions.</li>
    <li><em>Turbo Native</em> lets your <a href="https://m.signalvnoise.com/the-majestic-monolith/">majestic monolith</a> form the center of your native iOS and Android apps, with seamless transitions between web and native sections.</li>
  </ul>

  <p>
    It's all done by sending HTML over the wire. And for those instances when that's not enough, you can reach for the other side of <a href="https://hotwire.dev">Hotwire</a>, and finish the job with <a href="https://stimulus.hotwire.dev">Stimulus</a>.
