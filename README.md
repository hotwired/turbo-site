# The Turbo website

This repository backs the website living at https://turbo.hotwired.dev.

To work on it locally:

## Option A: Directly on your machine

1. `npm install`
2. `npm run serve`
3.  (If you need it: `npm install markdown-it` and rerun step #2).

## Option B: Using a devcontainer

There is a devcontainer configuration that, when started, will perform all of the setup and serve the website on port 8080.

For example, in VSCode, run "Reopen in Container" and wait for it to finish and access the site on http://localhost:8080/,
