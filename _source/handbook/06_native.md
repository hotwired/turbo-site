# Go Native on iOS & Android

Hotwire Native for iOS provides the tooling to wrap your Turbo-enabled web app in a native iOS shell. It manages a single WKWebView instance across multiple view controllers, giving you native navigation UI with all the client-side performance benefits of Turbo. See <a href="https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-ios/">Hotwire Native: iOS</a> for more details.

Hotwire Native for Android provides the same kind of tooling, managing a single WebView instance across multiple Fragment destinations. See <a href="https://github.com/hotwired/hotwire-native-android/">Hotwire Native: Android</a> for more details.

The best way to see what's possible with the native adapters is to setup the demo native application. We have one [for iOS](https://native.hotwired.dev/ios/getting-started) and [for Android](https://native.hotwired.dev/android/getting-started). You can open the code in your native environments and follow along to explore all the features.
