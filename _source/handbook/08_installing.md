# Installing Turbo in Your Application

Turbo can either be referenced in compiled form via the Turbo distributable script directly in the `<head>` of your application or through npm via a bundler like esbuild.

## In Compiled Form

You can float on the latest release of Turbo using a CDN bundler like Skypack. See <a href="https://www.skypack.dev/view/@hotwired/turbo">https://www.skypack.dev/view/@hotwired/turbo</a> for more details. Or <a href="https://unpkg.com/browse/@hotwired/turbo@latest/dist/">download the compiled packages from unpkg</a>.

## As An npm Package

You can install Turbo from npm via the `npm` or `yarn` packaging tools. Then require or import that in your code:

```javascript
import * as Turbo from "@hotwired/turbo"
```

## In a Ruby on Rails application

The Turbo JavaScript framework is included with [the turbo-rails gem](https://github.com/hotwired/turbo-rails) for direct use with the asset pipeline.
